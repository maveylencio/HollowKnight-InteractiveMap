This code initializes a simple leaflet map with custom coordinate system (CRS). The custom CRS is defined by crs variable and it uses a L.Transformation object to transform the coordinates.

The following parameters for the map are defined:

mapExtent: the extent of the map in the coordinate system
mapMinZoom: the minimum zoom level
mapMaxZoom: the maximum zoom level
mapMaxResolution: the maximum resolution for the map
tileExtent: the extent of the tiles in the coordinate system

The custom CRS is defined as follows:
crs.transformation: a L.Transformation object that defines the transformation of the coordinates
crs.scale: a function that returns the scale based on the zoom level
crs.zoom: a function that returns the zoom level based on the scale
L.CRS.Simple: dont need to be georeferenced, such as image-based maps, game maps
crs.unproject: takes a point argument and returns a geographical point (latitude, longitude) 
that corresponds to the given point in the projected coordinate system.

A L.Map object is created with the following options:
maxZoom: set to mapMaxZoom
minZoom: set to mapMinZoom
crs: set to the custom CRS defined as crs
maxBoundsViscosity: set to 1.0
maxBounds: set to the bounds of the map using the custom CRS's unproject method

A tile layer is added to the map using the L.tileLayer method with the following options:
minZoom: set to mapMinZoom
maxZoom: set to mapMaxZoom
tileSize: set to 2048 x 1024 pixels
noWrap: set to true to prevent tiles from wrapping around the edges
tms: set to false to indicate that the tiles are not TMS-style
Finally, the map is fitted to the bounds defined by mapExtent using the custom CRS's unproject method.
